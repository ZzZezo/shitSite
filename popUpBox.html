  //the functions the buttons should run have to be implemented in the main script and not in the "library script"
  function opt1(){ //example for option 1
      console.log("Option 1 chosen");
  }

  function opt2(){ //example for option 2
      console.log("Option 2 chosen")
  }

  function opt3(argument){ //example for option 3
    console.log("Option 3 chosen")
    console.log(argument)
  }

  
  createPopup("Title", "Text", 2, ["Option 1","Option 2"],[opt1,opt2]);  // Call the function to create the popup
  //createPopup(TheTextInBlueBar,TheTextInBox,HowManyButtons,TheTextOnTheButtons,TheFunctionsWhenButtonsPressed)


  //to pass a function with arguments you have to use this syntax: (can be used without args too, but costs readability and simplicity yk)
  createPopup("Title", "Text", 1, ["Pass Variable"],[function(){return opt3("Example String");}]);


  //if you wanna test those functions you have to comment on out, or it will always only display the second popup
  //(you can only ever have one popup at a time)
  //(if you create multiple without closing them you will just duplicate the last one created over and over again)
  //this is because im incredibly bad at coding (but also a bit cuz im legit so fucking tired rn)
  

//below here has nothing to do with popup anymore i just think it looks better idk man
